The idea of "IAM" project is to provide a cross site and cross platform method to share user credential in a secure way.

Storage -  decentralized data shared across multiple sites and users, such as bitcoin concept. 

User Features:
- Users can set up their account to:
  1) Set up group or individual online wallet(s). 
  2) Each group or individual wallet will have a unique & shareable credential.  The credential is auto generated random text. 
  3) Each wallet will have a list of applicalbe privacy policy, such as contact info, user name, shareable info, pre-accept privacy term.
  4) Multiple payment wallet(s) can be set up and apply for group or individual wallet. 
  5) When user sign up a new participate website, instead of filling up user information, user can choose to use "IAM" account and 
  pick the wallet that match the privacy term set by the website. User doesn't need to fill in their information.  If the website requires 
  user name & password for sign up, "IAM" will use the wallet global & unique name for login name, and generated unique password for that website 
  for signing up. 
  6) When login, user just uses the wallet name, and the associated login credential (that for login elsewhere other than "IAM" system)
  7) User can view the sites that uses & belongs to a wallet.  User can change it anytime.
