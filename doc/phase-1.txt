Phase I:

Let's make it simple first. 

1) Create privileges with different classes.
2) Set privileges ranking(??) for how important a privilege is to user.
3) Create simple user with multiple accounts, each with user privileges.


// Look into Bitcoin specification.

// Storage
Instead of centralized storage, a better approach will be distributed data among close social network / circle of the user. 
A user's data is  stored partially on each of his individual social point (friends).
